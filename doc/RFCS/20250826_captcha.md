- Feature Name: Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA
- Status: In Progress
- Created: 2025-08-26

## Summary

We propose integrating **Cloudflare Turnstile** to protect our signup flow against automated bot activity, while maintaining a seamless experience for legitimate users.

## Motivation

Puter allocates resources to **free** user account — including storage, compute, and AI credits. To prevent these from being exploited by bots, we need a more robust verification mechanism. Although Puter currently includes a [custom CAPTCHA service](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter/blob/4c3a68ee51a1b255edbe6b3c7e4c4e3b0394dae3/src/backend/src/modules/captcha/services/CaptchaService.js), it has several shortcomings:

* The text-recognition CAPTCHA creates friction and disrupts the user experience.
* Maintaining a token pool is resource-intensive and doesn’t scale well. The validation logic also requires ongoing maintenance within the codebase.

## Choose of Service Provider

We choose Cloudflare Turnstile since:

* It's free for unlimited use.
* It's easy to integrate.
* It's relative secure.

Here's a comparison of major CAPTCHA providers:

## Implementation

### Signup Flow

When a user submits the signup form, the client will include a **Turnstile token** alongside the other form data.
On the backend, Puter will call the **Cloudflare Turnstile verification API** to validate this token before provisioning a new account.

Only if the token is verified as valid will the signup request be processed. Invalid or missing tokens will result in a rejected signup attempt.
